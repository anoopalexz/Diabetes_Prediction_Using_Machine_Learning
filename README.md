# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
Project Overview:
	This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes using machine learning classification algorithms. It leverages a dataset containing information such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels to make predictions. Early diabetes prediction can be crucial for timely intervention and improved healthcare outcomes.

Diabetes Prediction:
	The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level (Hemoglobin A1c), and blood glucose level. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.

Dataset:
	The dataset used in this project Diabeties prediction dataset from kaggle. It was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

Attributes:
	Age: Age is a significant predictor of diabetes risk.
	Gender: Gender can influence diabetes risk.
	Body Mass Index (BMI): Higher BMI is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
	Hypertension: Hypertension is a coexisting risk factor for diabetes.
	Heart Disease: Heart disease is bidirectionally linked with diabetes.
	Smoking History: Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for diabetes.
	HbA1c Level: HbA1c indicates long-term blood sugar control.
	Blood Glucose Level: Elevated blood glucose levels are indicative of diabetes risk.
	Diabetes: The target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

Methodology:
	Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
	Various classification algorithms were explored.
